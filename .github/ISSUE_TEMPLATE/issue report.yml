        ### General preliminary information

        Please keep the following in mind when creating this issue:

        1. Fill in as much of the template as possible. When you are unsure about the relevancy of a section, do include the information requested in that section. Only leave out information in sections when you are completely sure about it not being relevant.
        2. Provide as much detail as possible. Do not assume other people to know what is going on.
        3. Keep everything readable and structured. Nobody enjoys reading poorly written reports that are difficult to understand.
        4. Keep an eye on your report as long as it is open, your involvement might be requested at a later moment.
        5. Keep the title short and descriptive. The title is not the place to write down a full description of the issue.
        6. When deciding to leave out information in a field, leave it blank and empty. Avoid writing things such as `n/a` for empty fields.

        After upgrading to version x.y.z of Jellyfin, the "login disclaimer" is showing incorrect text. It appears to me that it is appending the server name to the end of the login disclaimer, and showing that to a user. It might be a regression from pull request x. I have tried rebooting my host as well as my container multiple times. I tested this functionality on different clients, and it happens to all the tested clients (client x, y, z), that support the login disclaimer functionality. This makes me believe it is a server side issue.

        When providing logs, please keep the following things in mind:
        1. **DO NOT** use external paste services. If logs are too large to paste into the field, upload them as text files.
        2. Please provide complete logs.
          - For server logs, ensure to capture all relevant information, encompassing both the events leading up to and following the occurrence of the issue. Typically, providing 10 *lines preceding and succeeding* the problem should be adequate.
          - For ffmpeg logs, please provide the entire file unmodified.
        3. Please do not run logs through any translation program. We exclusively accept raw, untranslated logs. Particularly exercise caution if your browser automatically translates pages by default.
          - Do not forget to censor out personal information such as public IP addresses.
        4. Please do not include logs as screenshots, with the only exception being client logs in browsers.
