    <review>The Best of 1980-1990 is the first greatest hits compilation by Irish rock band U2, released in November 1998. It mostly contains the group&apos;s hit singles from the eighties but also mixes in some live staples as well as one new recording, Sweetest Thing. In April 1999, a companion video (featuring music videos and live footage) was released. The album was followed by another compilation, The Best of 1990-2000, in 2002.&#x0A;A limited edition version containing a special B-sides disc was released on the same date as the single-disc version. At the time of release, the official word was that the 2-disc album would be available the first week the album went on sale, then pulled from the stores. While this threat never materialized, it did result in the 2-disc version being in very high demand. Both versions charted in the Billboard 200.&#x0A;The boy on the cover is Peter Rowan, brother of Bono&apos;s friend Guggi (real name Derek Rowan) of the Virgin Prunes. He also appears on the covers of the early EP Three, two of the band&apos;s first three albums (Boy and War), and Early Demos.</review>
