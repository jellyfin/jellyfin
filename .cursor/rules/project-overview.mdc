# Jellyfin Project Overview

## What is Jellyfin?

Jellyfin is a Free Software Media System that manages and streams media. It's an alternative to proprietary solutions like Emby and Plex, providing media from a dedicated server to end-user devices.

## Tech Stack

- **.NET 10.0** (net10.0) - Core framework (README may reference .NET 9 SDK)
- **C#** with nullable reference types enabled
- **ASP.NET Core** - Web framework
- **Entity Framework Core** - ORM with SQLite
- **Serilog** - Logging framework
- **Prometheus** - Metrics
- **Swagger/ReDoc** - API documentation
- **xUnit, Moq, AutoFixture** - Testing

## Project Structure

### Core Projects

- `Jellyfin.Server` - Main server application and entry point
- `Jellyfin.Api` - REST API controllers and endpoints
- `Jellyfin.Server.Implementations` - Server-specific implementations
- `MediaBrowser.Controller` - Core interfaces and abstractions
- `MediaBrowser.Common` - Shared common code
- `MediaBrowser.Model` - Data models and DTOs

### Domain Projects

- `Emby.Server.Implementations` - Core server implementations (legacy naming)
- `Emby.Naming` - File naming conventions
- `MediaBrowser.MediaEncoding` - Media encoding logic
- `MediaBrowser.Providers` - Metadata providers
- `src/Jellyfin.*` - Modern modular features (LiveTv, Database, Extensions, etc.)

### Tests

All test projects follow pattern: `tests/[ProjectName].Tests/`

## Architecture Principles

- **Dependency Injection**: All services registered via DI container
- **Interface-based**: Core abstractions in `MediaBrowser.Controller`
- **Separation of Concerns**: API, business logic, and data layers are distinct
- **Configuration**: Centralized package management (`Directory.Packages.props`)

## Build Configuration

- Warnings treated as errors (`TreatWarningsAsErrors=true`)
- Analysis mode enabled in Debug builds
- StyleCop, Roslyn analyzers, and custom analyzers enforced
- Central package version management enabled

## Contribution Guidelines

### Before Starting Work

1. Browse the [issues list](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/issues)
2. Comment on an issue to indicate intent to work on it (prevents duplication)
3. If no issue exists for your changes, create one first and reference it in your PR

### Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Add upstream remote: `git remote add upstream git@github.com:jellyfin/jellyfin.git`
4. Create a feature branch off `master`: `git checkout -b my-feature master`
5. Make changes and commit to your feature branch
6. Rebase against upstream/master before submitting
7. Push to your fork and create a PR against upstream `master`

### CONTRIBUTORS.md

First-time contributors should add themselves to `CONTRIBUTORS.md` at the bottom of the "Jellyfin Contributors" section.

### Pull Request Requirements

- Use imperative mood in PR titles (e.g., "Add LDAP support", not "Added LDAP support")
- Keep title short, descriptive, with proper capitalization but no punctuation
- Follow the PR template and explain:
  - Why changes are being made (reference issues with `fixes`, `closes`, etc.)
  - How you approached the issue
- Mark unfinished PRs as "draft"
- Squash "junk" commits but keep logical commits separate
- All PRs require at least 2 team member reviews before merging to `master`
- Avoid rebasing/force-pushing after reviews when possible

### Branch Strategy

- **master** - Primary development branch, all PRs target this branch
- **Feature branches** - Created for major projects requiring multiple PRs
