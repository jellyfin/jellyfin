Notes on preparation of the Second Edition:

- Worked from http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-19980210-errata.
- Changed DTD reference to point to V2.1 of XMLspec.
- Moved version number from <title> to <version> element and
  added "second edition" wording.  Mentioned edition information
  in status.
- Removed bgcolor="&cellback;" attributes from all <td>
  elements because that attribute is not in the current table model.
- Reversed status and abstract, so that abstract is first, according
  to W3C guidelines.
- Changed some <emph>s to <titleref>s in bibliography.
- Changed some <code>s to <at> etc. throughout; where used <attval>,
  removed existing <quote>s because the stylesheet produces them.
- Removed some spurious spaces.
- Added affiliation markup to the original member list.
- Added commas between individual <thisver> elements, because
  whitespace is now significant there.
- Moved <eg>s, <scrap>s, and lists outside of <p>s for cleaner HTML
  conversion.
- Revised Status section to reflect new status.
- Fixed all titleref hrefs so they get transformed properly; at
  next revision, these all probably need to be changed to some
  other markup.
- Incorporated all errata (barring obsoleted and invalid ones);
  added links to the errata document with <loc role="erratumref">
  elements; used diff="{add|chg|del}" attribute.  This version 
  expects that the official HTML output will have diff="del" 
  elements suppressed.

<abstract>
<p>The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a subset of SGML that is completely
described in this document. Its goal is to enable generic SGML to be served,
received, and processed on the Web in the way that is now possible with HTML.
XML has been designed for ease of implementation and for interoperability
with both SGML and HTML.</p>
</abstract>
<status>
<p>This document has been reviewed by W3C Members and other interested parties
and has been endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable
document and may be used as reference material or cited as a normative reference
from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw
attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This
enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web.</p>
<p>This document specifies a syntax created by subsetting an existing, widely
used international text processing standard (Standard Generalized Markup Language,
ISO 8879:1986(E) as amended and corrected) for use on the World Wide Web.
It is a product of the W3C XML Activity, details of which can be found at <loc

<p diff="add">This second edition is <emph>not</emph> a new version of XML (first published 10 February 1998);
it merely incorporates the changes dictated by the first-edition errata (available
at <loc href="http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-19980210-errata">http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-19980210-errata</loc>)

<sitem>1997-12-03 : CMSMcQ : yet further changes</sitem>
<sitem>1997-12-02 : TB : further changes (see TB to XML WG, 2 December 1997)</sitem>
<sitem>1997-12-02 : CMSMcQ : deal with as many corrections and comments from
the proofreaders as possible: entify hard-coded document date in pubdate element,
change expansion of entity WebSGML, update status description as per Dan Connolly
(am not sure about refernece to Berners-Lee et al.), add 'The' to abstract
as per WG decision, move Relationship to Existing Standards to back matter
and combine with References, re-order back matter so normative appendices
come first, re-tag back matter so informative appendices are tagged informdiv1,
remove XXX XXX from list of 'normative' specs in prose, move some references
from Other References to Normative References, add RFC 1738, 1808, and 2141
to Other References (they are not normative since we do not require the processor
to enforce any rules based on them), add reference to 'Fielding draft' (Berners-Lee
et al.), move notation section to end of body, drop URIchar non-terminal and
use SkipLit instead, lose stray reference to defunct nonterminal 'markupdecls',
move reference to Aho et al. into appendix (Tim's right), add prose note saying
that hash marks and fragment identifiers are NOT part of the URI formally
speaking, and are NOT legal in system identifiers (processor 'may' signal
an error). Work through: Tim Bray reacting to James Clark, Tim Bray on his
own, Eve Maler, NOT DONE YET: change binary / text to unparsed / parsed. handle
James's suggestion about &lt; in attriubte values uppercase hex characters,
namechar list, </sitem>
<sitem>1997-12-01 : JB : add some column-width parameters</sitem>
<sitem>1997-12-01 : CMSMcQ : begin round of changes to incorporate recent
WG decisions and other corrections: binding sources of character encoding
info (27 Aug / 3 Sept), correct wording of Faust quotation (restore dropped
line), drop SDD from EncodingDecl, change text at version number 1.0, drop
misleading (wrong!) sentence about ignorables and extenders, modify definition
of PCData to make bar on msc grammatical, change grammar's handling of internal
subset (drop non-terminal markupdecls), change definition of includeSect to
allow conditional sections, add integral-declaration constraint on internal
subset, drop misleading / dangerous sentence about relationship of entities
with system storage objects, change table body tag to htbody as per EM change
to DTD, add rule about space normalization in public identifiers, add description
of how to generate our name-space rules from Unicode character database (needs
further work!). </sitem>
<sitem>1997-10-08 : TB : Removed %-constructs again, new rules for PE appearance.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-10-01 : TB : Case-sensitive markup; cleaned up element-type defs,
lotsa little edits for style</sitem>
<sitem>1997-09-25 : TB : Change to elm's new DTD, with substantial detail
cleanup as a side-effect</sitem>
<sitem>1997-07-24 : CMSMcQ : correct error (lost *) in definition of ignoreSectContents
(thanks to Makoto Murata)</sitem>
<sitem>Allow all empty elements to have end-tags, consistent with SGML TC
(as per JJC).</sitem>
<sitem>1997-07-23 : CMSMcQ : pre-emptive strike on pending corrections: introduce
the term 'empty-element tag', note that all empty elements may use it, and
elements declared EMPTY must use it. Add WFC requiring encoding decl to come
first in an entity. Redefine notations to point to PIs as well as binary entities.
Change autodetection table by removing bytes 3 and 4 from examples with Byte
Order Mark. Add content model as a term and clarify that it applies to both
mixed and element content. </sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-30 : CMSMcQ : change date, some cosmetic changes, changes to
productions for choice, seq, Mixed, NotationType, Enumeration. Follow James
Clark's suggestion and prohibit conditional sections in internal subset. TO
DO: simplify production for ignored sections as a result, since we don't need
to worry about parsers which don't expand PErefs finding a conditional section.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-29 : TB : various edits</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-29 : CMSMcQ : further changes: Suppress old FINAL EDIT comments
and some dead material. Revise occurrences of % in grammar to exploit Henry
Thompson's pun, especially markupdecl and attdef. Remove RMD requirement relating
to element content (?). </sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-28 : CMSMcQ : Various changes for 1 July draft: Add text for
draconian error handling (introduce the term Fatal Error). RE deleta est (changing
wording from original announcement to restrict the requirement to validating
parsers). Tag definition of validating processor and link to it. Add colon
as name character. Change def of %operator. Change standard definitions of
lt, gt, amp. Strip leading zeros from #x00nn forms.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-04-02 : CMSMcQ : final corrections of editorial errors found in
last night's proofreading. Reverse course once more on well-formed: Webster's
Second hyphenates it, and that's enough for me.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-04-01 : CMSMcQ : corrections from JJC, EM, HT, and self</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-31 : Tim Bray : many changes</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-29 : CMSMcQ : some Henry Thompson (on entity handling), some
Charles Goldfarb, some ERB decisions (PE handling in miscellaneous declarations.
Changed Ident element to accept def attribute. Allow normalization of Unicode
characters. move def of systemliteral into section on literals.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-28 : CMSMcQ : make as many corrections as possible, from Terry
Allen, Norbert Mikula, James Clark, Jon Bosak, Henry Thompson, Paul Grosso,
and self. Among other things: give in on "well formed" (Terry is right), tentatively
rename QuotedCData as AttValue and Literal as EntityValue to be more informative,
since attribute values are the <emph>only</emph> place QuotedCData was used,
and vice versa for entity text and Literal. (I'd call it Entity Text, but
8879 uses that name for both internal and external entities.)</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-26 : CMSMcQ : resynch the two forks of this draft, reapply
my changes dated 03-20 and 03-21. Normalize old 'may not' to 'must not' except
in the one case where it meant 'may or may not'.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-21 : TB : massive changes on plane flight from Chicago to Vancouver</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-21 : CMSMcQ : correct as many reported errors as possible. </sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-20 : CMSMcQ : correct typos listed in CMSMcQ hand copy of spec.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-20 : CMSMcQ : cosmetic changes preparatory to revision for
WWW conference April 1997: restore some of the internal entity references
(e.g. to docdate, etc.), change character xA0 to &amp;nbsp; and define nbsp
as &amp;#160;, and refill a lot of paragraphs for legibility.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-11-12 : CMSMcQ : revise using Tim's edits: Add list type of NUMBERED
and change most lists either to BULLETS or to NUMBERED. Suppress QuotedNames,
Names (not used). Correct trivial-grammar doc type decl. Rename 'marked section'
as 'CDATA section' passim. Also edits from James Clark: Define the set of
characters from which [^abc] subtracts. Charref should use just [0-9] not
Digit. Location info needs cleaner treatment: remove? (ERB question). One
example of a PI has wrong pic. Clarify discussion of encoding names. Encoding
failure should lead to unspecified results; don't prescribe error recovery.
Don't require exposure of entity boundaries. Ignore white space in element
content. Reserve entity names of the form u-NNNN. Clarify relative URLs. And
some of my own: Correct productions for content model: model cannot consist
of a name, so "elements ::= cp" is no good. </sitem>
<sitem>1996-11-11 : CMSMcQ : revise for style. Add new rhs to entity declaration,
for parameter entities.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-11-10 : CMSMcQ : revise for style. Fix / complete section on names,
characters. Add sections on parameter entities, conditional sections. Still
to do: Add compatibility note on deterministic content models. Finish stylistic
revision.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-31 : TB : Add Entity Handling section</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-30 : TB : Clean up term &amp; termdef. Slip in ERB decision
re EMPTY.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-28 : TB : Change DTD. Implement some of Michael's suggestions.
Change comments back to //. Introduce language for XML namespace reservation.
Add section on white-space handling. Lots more cleanup.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-24 : CMSMcQ : quick tweaks, implement some ERB decisions. Characters
are not integers. Comments are /* */ not //. Add bibliographic refs to 10646,
HyTime, Unicode. Rename old Cdata as MsData since it's <emph>only</emph> seen
in marked sections. Call them attribute-value pairs not name-value pairs,
except once. Internal subset is optional, needs '?'. Implied attributes should
be signaled to the app, not have values supplied by processor.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-16 : TB : track down &amp; excise all DSD references; introduce
some EBNF for entity declarations.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-?? : TB : consistency check, fix up scraps so they all parse,
get formatter working, correct a few productions.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-10/11 : CMSMcQ : various maintenance, stylistic, and organizational
changes: Replace a few literals with xmlpio and pic entities, to make them
consistent and ensure we can change pic reliably when the ERB votes. Drop
paragraph on recognizers from notation section. Add match, exact match to
terminology. Move old 2.2 XML Processors and Apps into intro. Mention comments,
PIs, and marked sections in discussion of delimiter escaping. Streamline discussion
of doctype decl syntax. Drop old section of 'PI syntax' for doctype decl,
and add section on partial-DTD summary PIs to end of Logical Structures section.
Revise DSD syntax section to use Tim's subset-in-a-PI mechanism.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-10 : TB : eliminate name recognizers (and more?)</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-09 : CMSMcQ : revise for style, consistency through 2.3 (Characters)</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-09 : CMSMcQ : re-unite everything for convenience, at least
temporarily, and revise quickly</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-08 : TB : first major homogenization pass</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-08 : TB : turn "current" attribute on div type into CDATA</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-02 : TB : remould into skeleton + entities</sitem>
<sitem>1996-09-30 : CMSMcQ : add a few more sections prior to exchange with
Tim.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-09-20 : CMSMcQ : finish transcribing notes.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-09-19 : CMSMcQ : begin transcribing notes for draft.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-09-13 : CMSMcQ : made outline from notes of 09-06, do some housekeeping</sitem>

<head>Introduction</head>
<p>Extensible Markup Language, abbreviated XML, describes a class of data
objects called <termref def="dt-xml-doc">XML documents</termref> and partially
describes the behavior of computer programs which process them. XML is an
application profile or restricted form of SGML, the Standard Generalized Markup
Language <bibref ref="ISO8879"/>. By construction, XML documents are conforming
SGML documents.</p>
<p>XML documents are made up of storage units called <termref def="dt-entity">entities</termref>,
which contain either parsed or unparsed data. Parsed data is made up of <termref
def="dt-character">characters</termref>, some of which form <termref def="dt-chardata">character
data</termref>, and some of which form <termref def="dt-markup">markup</termref>.
Markup encodes a description of the document's storage layout and logical
structure. XML provides a mechanism to impose constraints on the storage layout
and logical structure.</p>
<p><termdef id="dt-xml-proc" term="XML Processor">A software module called
an <term>XML processor</term> is used to read XML documents and provide access
to their content and structure.</termdef> <termdef id="dt-app" term="Application">It
is assumed that an XML processor is doing its work on behalf of another module,
called the <term>application</term>.</termdef> This specification describes
the required behavior of an XML processor in terms of how it must read XML
data and the information it must provide to the application.</p>
<div2 id="sec-origin-goals">
<head>Origin and Goals</head>
<p>XML was developed by an XML Working Group (originally known as the SGML
Editorial Review Board) formed under the auspices of the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C) in 1996. It was chaired by Jon Bosak of Sun Microsystems with the active
participation of an XML Special Interest Group (previously known as the SGML
Working Group) also organized by the W3C. The membership of the XML Working
Group is given in an appendix. Dan Connolly served as the WG's contact with
the W3C.</p>
<p>The design goals for XML are:</p>
<olist>
<item><p>XML shall be straightforwardly usable over the Internet.</p></item>
<item><p>XML shall support a wide variety of applications.</p></item>
<item><p>XML shall be compatible with SGML.</p></item>
<item><p>It shall be easy to write programs which process XML documents.</p>
</item>
<item><p>The number of optional features in XML is to be kept to the absolute
minimum, ideally zero.</p></item>
<item><p>XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably clear.</p></item>
<item><p>The XML design should be prepared quickly.</p></item>
<item><p>The design of XML shall be formal and concise.</p></item>
<item><p>XML documents shall be easy to create.</p></item>
<item><p>Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance.</p></item>
</olist>
<p>This specification, together with associated standards (Unicode and ISO/IEC
10646 for characters, Internet RFC 1766 for language identification tags,
ISO 639 for language name codes, and ISO 3166 for country name codes), provides
all the information necessary to understand XML Version &versionOfXML; and
construct computer programs to process it.</p>
<p>This version of the XML specification <!-- is for &doc.audience;.--> &doc.distribution;.</p>
</div2>
<div2 id="sec-terminology">
<head>Terminology</head>
<p>The terminology used to describe XML documents is defined in the body of
this specification. The terms defined in the following list are used in building
those definitions and in describing the actions of an XML processor: <glist>
<gitem><label>may</label>
<def>
<p><termdef id="dt-may" term="May">Conforming documents and XML processors
are permitted to but need not behave as described.</termdef></p>
</def></gitem>
<gitem><label>must</label>
<def>
<p><termdef id="dt-must" term="Must">Conforming documents and XML processors
are required to behave as described; otherwise they are in error. <!-- do NOT change this! this is what defines a violation of
a 'must' clause as 'an error'. -MSM --></termdef></p>
</def></gitem>
<gitem><label>error</label>
<def>
<p><termdef id="dt-error" term="Error">A violation of the rules of this specification;
results are undefined. Conforming software may detect and report an error
and may recover from it.</termdef></p>
</def></gitem>
<gitem><label>fatal error</label>
<def>
<p><termdef id="dt-fatal" term="Fatal Error">An error which a conforming <termref
def="dt-xml-proc">XML processor</termref> must detect and report to the application.
After encountering a fatal error, the processor may continue processing the
data to search for further errors and may report such errors to the application.
In order to support correction of errors, the processor may make unprocessed
data from the document (with intermingled character data and markup) available
to the application. Once a fatal error is detected, however, the processor
must not continue normal processing (i.e., it must not continue to pass character
data and information about the document's logical structure to the application
in the normal way).</termdef></p>
</def></gitem>
<gitem><label>at user option</label>
<def>
<p><termdef id="dt-atuseroption" term="At user option">Conforming software
may or must (depending on the modal verb in the sentence) behave as described;
if it does, it must provide users a means to enable or disable the behavior
described.</termdef></p>

<gitem><label>validity constraint</label>
<def>
<p><termdef id="dt-vc" term="Validity constraint">A rule which applies to
all <termref def="dt-valid">valid</termref> XML documents. Violations of validity
constraints are errors; they must, at user option, be reported by <termref

<p>If both the external and internal subsets are used, the internal subset

<head>White Space Handling</head>
<p>In editing XML documents, it is often convenient to use <quote>white space</quote>
(spaces, tabs, and blank lines<phrase diff="del"><loc role="erratumref" href="http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-19980210-errata#E39">[E39]</loc>,
denoted by the nonterminal <nt def="NT-S">S</nt> in this specification</phrase>)
to set apart the markup for greater readability. Such white space is typically
not intended for inclusion in the delivered version of the document. On the
other hand, <quote>significant</quote> white space that should be preserved
in the delivered version is common, for example in poetry and source code.</p>
<p>An <termref def="dt-xml-proc">XML processor</termref> must always pass
all characters in a document that are not markup through to the application.
A <termref def="dt-validating"> validating XML processor</termref> must also
inform the application which of these characters constitute white space appearing
in <termref def="dt-elemcontent">element content</termref>.</p>
<p>A special <termref def="dt-attr">attribute</termref> named <att>xml:space</att>
may be attached to an element to signal an intention that in that element,
white space should be preserved by applications. In valid documents, this
attribute, like any other, must be <termref def="dt-attdecl">declared</termref>
if it is used. When declared, it must be given as an <termref def="dt-enumerated">enumerated
type</termref> whose <phrase diff="chg"><loc role="erratumref" href="http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-19980210-errata#E81">[E81]</loc>values
are one or both of</phrase> <attval>default</attval> and <attval>preserve</attval>.
For example:</p>
<eg diff="chg"><![CDATA[<!ATTLIST poem  xml:space (default|preserve) 'preserve'>]]>

&lt;!-- <loc role="erratumref" href="http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-19980210-errata#E81">[E81]</loc>-->
&lt;!ATTLIST pre xml:space (preserve) #FIXED 'preserve'></eg>
<p>The value <attval>default</attval> signals that applications' default white-space
processing modes are acceptable for this element; the value <attval>preserve</attval>
indicates the intent that applications preserve all the white space. This
declared intent is considered to apply to all elements within the content
of the element where it is specified, unless overriden with another instance
of the <att>xml:space</att> attribute.</p>
<p>The <termref def="dt-root">root element</termref> of any document is considered
to have signaled no intentions as regards application space handling, unless
it provides a value for this attribute or the attribute is declared with a
default value.</p>

wherever an external parsed entity or the literal entity value of an internal

must pass to the application the single character #xA. (This behavior can
conveniently be produced by normalizing all line breaks to #xA on input, before
parsing.)</p>

<head>Language Identification</head>
<p>In document processing, it is often useful to identify the natural or formal

Normalization</head>
<p>Before the value of an attribute is passed to the application or checked
for validity, the XML processor must normalize the attribute value by applying
the algorithm below, or by using some other method such that the value passed
to the application is the same as that produced by the algorithm.</p>
<olist>
<item><p>All line breaks must have been normalized on input to #xA as described
in <specref ref="sec-line-ends"/>, so the rest of this algorithm operates
on text normalized in this way.</p></item>
<item><p>Begin with a normalized value consisting of the empty string.</p>
</item>
<item><p>For each character, entity reference, or character reference in the
unnormalized attribute value, beginning with the first and continuing to the
last, do the following:</p>
<ulist>
<item><p>For a character reference, append the referenced character to the
normalized value.</p></item>
<item><p>For an entity reference, recursively apply step 3 of this algorithm
to the replacement text of the entity.</p></item>
<item><p>For a white space character (#x20, #xD, #xA, #x9), append a space
character (#x20) to the normalized value.</p></item>
<item><p>For another character, append the character to the normalized value.</p>
</item>
</ulist>
</item>
</olist>
<p>If the attribute type is not CDATA, then the XML processor must further
process the normalized attribute value by discarding any leading and trailing
space (#x20) characters, and by replacing sequences of space (#x20) characters
by a single space (#x20) character.</p>
<p>Note that if the unnormalized attribute value contains a character reference
to a white space character other than space (#x20), the normalized value contains
the referenced character itself (#xD, #xA or #x9). This contrasts with the
case where the unnormalized value contains a white space character (not a
reference), which is replaced with a space character (#x20) in the normalized
value and also contrasts with the case where the unnormalized value contains
an entity reference whose replacement text contains a white space character;
being recursively processed, the white space character is replaced with a
space character (#x20) in the normalized value.</p>
<p>All attributes for which no declaration has been read should be treated
by a non-validating <phrase diff="chg"><loc role="erratumref" href="http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-19980210-errata#E95">[E95]</loc>processor</phrase>
as if declared <kw>CDATA</kw>.</p>
<p>Following are examples of attribute normalization. Given the following
declarations:</p>
<eg>&lt;!ENTITY d "&amp;#xD;">
&lt;!ENTITY a "&amp;#xA;">
&lt;!ENTITY da "&amp;#xD;&amp;#xA;"></eg>
<p>the attribute specifications in the left column below would be normalized
to the character sequences of the middle column if the attribute <att>a</att>
is declared <kw>NMTOKENS</kw> and to those of the right columns if <att>a</att>
is declared <kw>CDATA</kw>.</p>
<table border="1" frame="border"><thead><tr><th>Attribute specification</th>
<th>a is NMTOKENS</th><th>a is CDATA</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><eg>a="

</vcnote>
<p>Like the internal and external DTD subsets, a conditional section may contain
one or more complete declarations, comments, processing instructions, or nested
conditional sections, intermingled with white space.</p>
<p>If the keyword of the conditional section is <kw>INCLUDE</kw>, then the

for reliable parsing, the contents of even ignored conditional sections must
be read in order to detect nested conditional sections and ensure that the
end of the outermost (ignored) conditional section is properly detected.</phrase>
If a conditional section with a keyword of <kw>INCLUDE</kw> occurs within
a larger conditional section with a keyword of <kw>IGNORE</kw>, both the outer

href="http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-19980210-errata#E90">[E90]</loc>The contents
of an ignored conditional section are parsed by ignoring all characters after
the "<code>[</code>" following the keyword, except conditional section starts
"<code>&lt;![</code>" and ends "<code>]]&gt;</code>", until the matching conditional
section end is found. Parameter entity references are not recognized in this
process.</phrase></p>
<p>If the keyword of the conditional section is a parameter-entity reference,
the parameter entity must be replaced by its content before the processor
decides whether to include or ignore the conditional section.</p>

<p>This rule is based on the recognition that the automatic inclusion provided

is the content of the entity, after replacement of character references and
parameter-entity references.</termdef></p>
<p>The literal entity value as given in an internal entity declaration (<nt
def="NT-EntityValue">EntityValue</nt>) may contain character, parameter-entity,
and general-entity references. Such references must be contained entirely
within the literal entity value. The actual replacement text that is <termref
def="dt-include">included</termref> as described above must contain the <emph>replacement
text</emph> of any parameter entities referred to, and must contain the character
referred to, in place of any character references in the literal entity value;
however, general-entity references must be left as-is, unexpanded. For example,
given the following declarations:</p>
<eg><![CDATA[<!ENTITY % pub    "&#xc9;ditions Gallimard" >
<!ENTITY   rights "All rights reserved" >
<!ENTITY   book   "La Peste: Albert Camus,

<p>then the replacement text for the entity <quote><code>book</code></quote>
is:</p>
<eg>La Peste: Albert Camus,
 1947 ditions Gallimard. &amp;rights;</eg>
<p>The general-entity reference <quote><code>&amp;rights;</code></quote> would
be expanded should the reference <quote><code>&amp;book;</code></quote> appear
in the document's content or an attribute value.</p>
<p>These simple rules may have complex interactions; for a detailed discussion

<div2 id="safe-behavior">
<head>Using XML Processors</head>
<p>The behavior of a validating XML processor is highly predictable; it must
read every piece of a document and report all well-formedness and validity
violations. Less is required of a non-validating processor; it need not read
any part of the document other than the document entity. This has two effects
that may be important to users of XML processors:</p>
<ulist>
<item><p>Certain well-formedness errors, specifically those that require reading
external entities, may not be detected by a non-validating processor. Examples
include the constraints entitled <titleref href="#wf-entdeclared">Entity Declared</titleref>, <titleref
href="#textent">Parsed Entity</titleref>, and <titleref href="#norecursion">No
Recursion</titleref>, as well as some of the cases described as <titleref
href="#forbidden">forbidden</titleref> in <specref ref="entproc"/>.</p></item>
<item><p>The information passed from the processor to the application may
vary, depending on whether the processor reads parameter and external entities.
For example, a non-validating processor may not <titleref href="#AVNormalize">normalize</titleref>
attribute values, <titleref href="#included">include</titleref> the replacement
text of internal entities, or supply <titleref href="#sec-attr-defaults">default
attribute values</titleref>, where doing so depends on having read declarations
in external or parameter entities.</p></item>
</ulist>
<p>For maximum reliability in interoperating between different XML processors,
applications which use non-validating processors should not rely on any behaviors
not required of such processors. Applications which require facilities such
as the use of default attributes or internal entities which are declared in
external entities should use validating XML processors.</p>
</div2>

<div1 id="sec-notation">
<head>Notation</head>
<p>The formal grammar of XML is given in this specification using a simple
Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) notation. Each rule in the grammar defines
one symbol, in the form</p>

<p>Symbols are written with an initial capital letter if they are <phrase

are used to match strings of one or more characters: <glist>

character in ISO/IEC 10646 whose canonical (UCS-4) code value, when interpreted
as an unsigned binary number, has the value indicated. The number of leading
zeros in the <code>#xN</code> form is insignificant; the number of leading
zeros in the corresponding code value is governed by the character encoding
in use and is not significant for XML.</p>

<head>Expansion of Entity and Character References</head>
<p>This appendix contains some examples illustrating the sequence of entity-
and character-reference recognition and expansion, as specified in <specref
ref="entproc"/>.</p>
<p>If the DTD contains the declaration</p>
<eg><![CDATA[<!ENTITY example "<p>An ampersand (&#38;#38;) may be escaped
numerically (&#38;#38;#38;) or with a general entity
(&amp;amp;).</p>" >]]></eg>
<p>then the XML processor will recognize the character references when it
parses the entity declaration, and resolve them before storing the following
string as the value of the entity <quote><code>example</code></quote>:</p>
<eg><![CDATA[<p>An ampersand (&#38;) may be escaped
numerically (&#38;#38;) or with a general entity
(&amp;amp;).</p>]]></eg>
<p>A reference in the document to <quote><code>&amp;example;</code></quote>
will cause the text to be reparsed, at which time the start- and end-tags
of the <el>p</el> element will be recognized and the three references will
be recognized and expanded, resulting in a <el>p</el> element with the following
content (all data, no delimiters or markup):</p>
<eg><![CDATA[An ampersand (&) may be escaped
numerically (&#38;) or with a general entity
(&amp;).]]></eg>
<p>A more complex example will illustrate the rules and their effects fully.
In the following example, the line numbers are solely for reference.</p>
<eg><![CDATA[1 <?xml version='1.0'?>
2 <!DOCTYPE test [
3 <!ELEMENT test (#PCDATA) >
4 <!ENTITY % xx '&#37;zz;'>
5 <!ENTITY % zz '&#60;!ENTITY tricky "error-prone" >' >
6 %xx;
7 ]>
8 <test>This sample shows a &tricky; method.</test>]]></eg>
<p>This produces the following:</p>
<ulist spacing="compact">
<item><p>in line 4, the reference to character 37 is expanded immediately,
and the parameter entity <quote><code>xx</code></quote> is stored in the symbol
table with the value <quote><code>%zz;</code></quote>. Since the replacement
text is not rescanned, the reference to parameter entity <quote><code>zz</code></quote>
is not recognized. (And it would be an error if it were, since <quote><code>zz</code></quote>
is not yet declared.)</p></item>
<item><p>in line 5, the character reference <quote><code>&amp;#60;</code></quote>
is expanded immediately and the parameter entity <quote><code>zz</code></quote>
is stored with the replacement text <quote><code>&lt;!ENTITY tricky "error-prone"
></code></quote>, which is a well-formed entity declaration.</p></item>
<item><p>in line 6, the reference to <quote><code>xx</code></quote> is recognized,
and the replacement text of <quote><code>xx</code></quote> (namely <quote><code>%zz;</code></quote>)
is parsed. The reference to <quote><code>zz</code></quote> is recognized in
its turn, and its replacement text (<quote><code>&lt;!ENTITY tricky "error-prone"
></code></quote>) is parsed. The general entity <quote><code>tricky</code></quote>
has now been declared, with the replacement text <quote><code>error-prone</code></quote>.</p>
</item>
<item><p>in line 8, the reference to the general entity <quote><code>tricky</code></quote>
is recognized, and it is expanded, so the full content of the <el>test</el>
element is the self-describing (and ungrammatical) string <emph>This sample
shows a error-prone method.</emph></p></item>

<head>Deterministic Content Models</head>
<p><phrase diff="chg"><loc role="erratumref" href="http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-19980210-errata#E102">[E102]</loc>As
noted in <specref ref="sec-element-content"/>, it is required that content
models in element type declarations be deterministic. This requirement is <termref
def="dt-compat">for compatibility</termref> with SGML (which calls deterministic
content models <quote>unambiguous</quote>);</phrase> XML processors built
using SGML systems may flag non-deterministic content models as errors.</p>
<p>For example, the content model <code>((b, c) | (b, d))</code> is non-deterministic,
because given an initial <el>b</el> the <phrase diff="chg"><loc role="erratumref"
href="http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-19980210-errata#E95">[E95]</loc>XML processor</phrase>
cannot know which <el>b</el> in the model is being matched without looking
ahead to see which element follows the <el>b</el>. In this case, the two references
to <el>b</el> can be collapsed into a single reference, making the model read <code>(b,
(c | d))</code>. An initial <el>b</el> now clearly matches only a single name
in the content model. The <phrase diff="chg"><loc role="erratumref" href="http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-19980210-errata#E95">[E95]</loc>processor</phrase
> doesn't need to look ahead to see what follows; either <el>c</el> or <el>d</el>
would be accepted.</p>
<p>More formally: a finite state automaton may be constructed from the content
model using the standard algorithms, e.g. algorithm 3.5 in section 3.9 of
Aho, Sethi, and Ullman <bibref ref="Aho"/>. In many such algorithms, a follow
set is constructed for each position in the regular expression (i.e., each
leaf node in the syntax tree for the regular expression); if any position
has a follow set in which more than one following position is labeled with
the same element type name, then the content model is in error and may be
reported as an error.</p>
<p>Algorithms exist which allow many but not all non-deterministic content
models to be reduced automatically to equivalent deterministic models; see
Brggemann-Klein 1991 <bibref ref="ABK"/>.</p>

of Character Encodings</head>
<p>The XML encoding declaration functions as an internal label on each entity,
indicating which character encoding is in use. Before an XML processor can
read the internal label, however, it apparently has to know what character
encoding is in use&mdash;which is what the internal label is trying to indicate.
In the general case, this is a hopeless situation. It is not entirely hopeless
in XML, however, because XML limits the general case in two ways: each implementation
is assumed to support only a finite set of character encodings, and the XML
encoding declaration is restricted in position and content in order to make
it feasible to autodetect the character encoding in use in each entity in
normal cases. Also, in many cases other sources of information are available
in addition to the XML data stream itself. Two cases may be distinguished,
depending on whether the XML entity is presented to the processor without,
or with, any accompanying (external) information. We consider the first case
first.</p>
<div2 id="sec-guessing-no-ext-info">

<note diff="add">
<p>In cases above which do not require reading the encoding declaration to
determine the encoding, section 4.3.3 still requires that the encoding declaration,
if present, be read and that the encoding name be checked to match the actual
encoding of the entity. Also, it is possible that new character encodings
will be invented that will make it necessary to use the encoding declaration
to determine the encoding, in cases where this is not required at present.</p>
</note>
<p>This level of autodetection is enough to read the XML encoding declaration
and parse the character-encoding identifier, which is still necessary to distinguish
the individual members of each family of encodings (e.g. to tell UTF-8 from
8859, and the parts of 8859 from each other, or to distinguish the specific
EBCDIC code page in use, and so on).</p>
<p>Because the contents of the encoding declaration are restricted to <phrase
diff="chg">characters from the ASCII repertoire (however encoded)</phrase>,
a processor can reliably read the entire encoding declaration as soon as it
has detected which family of encodings is in use. Since in practice, all widely
used character encodings fall into one of the categories above, the XML encoding
declaration allows reasonably reliable in-band labeling of character encodings,
even when external sources of information at the operating-system or transport-protocol
level are unreliable. <phrase diff="del">Note that since external parsed entities
in UTF-16 may begin with any character, this autodetection does not always
work. Also, </phrase><phrase diff="add">Character encodings such as UTF-7
that make overloaded usage of ASCII-valued bytes may fail to be reliably detected.</phrase></p>
<p>Once the processor has detected the character encoding in use, it can act
appropriately, whether by invoking a separate input routine for each case,
or by calling the proper conversion function on each character of input.</p>
<p>Like any self-labeling system, the XML encoding declaration will not work
if any software changes the entity's character set or encoding without updating
the encoding declaration. Implementors of character-encoding routines should
be careful to ensure the accuracy of the internal and external information
used to label the entity.</p>

<head diff="add">Priorities in the Presence of External Encoding Information</head>
<p>The second possible case occurs when the XML entity is accompanied by encoding
information, as in some file systems and some network protocols. When multiple
sources of information are available, their relative priority and the preferred
method of handling conflict should be specified as part of the higher-level
protocol used to deliver XML. <phrase diff="chg">In particular, please refer
to <bibref ref="rfc2376"/> or its successor, which defines the <code>text/xml</code>
and <code>application/xml</code> MIME types and provides some useful guidance.
In the interests of interoperability, however, the following rule is recommended.</phrase></p>

the <code>charset</code> parameter on the MIME type determines the character
