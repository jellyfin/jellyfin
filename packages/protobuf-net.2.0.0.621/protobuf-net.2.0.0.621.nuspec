    <description>Protocol Buffers is the name of the binary serialization format used by Google for much of their data communications. It is designed to be: small in size - efficient data storage (far smaller than xml) cheap to process - both at the client and server platform independent - portable between different programming architectures extensible - to add new data to old messages. protobuf-net is a .NET implementation of this, allowing you to serialize your .NET objects efficiently and easily. It is compatible with most of the .NET family, including .NET 2.0/3.0/3.5/4.0, .NET CF 2.0/3.5, Mono 2.x, Silverlight, etc.</description>
    <summary>Provides simple access to fast and efficient "Protocol Buffers" serialization from .NET applications</summary>
    <releaseNotes>* 2.0.0.621 - fix: nasty regression in r619, where GetSchema() could cause base-type corruption
      * 2.0.0.619 - fix: GetSchema() should use ultimate base-type names when modelling inheritance
                  - fix: ensure precomile always generates a .ctor() on the concrete serializer
                  - add: support out-of-order fields when deseiralizing inheritance from other protobuf implementations
      * 2.0.0.614 - fix: enum handling of ": byte" confusing signed/unsigned bytes
      * 2.0.0.612 - fix: allow adding enum maps at runtime via MetaType
      * 2.0.0.611 - fix: *Specified should work with non-public methods
                  - performance: pre-compiled serializers now use dictionary lookups where appropriate
                  - fix: nuget package for portable library should be more inclusive
      * 2.0.0.602 - added precompiler support for internal-types and [InternalsVisibleTo(...)]-forwarding
                  - made AllowParseableTypes available on default type-model
      * 2.0.0.601 - added phone8 support</releaseNotes>
