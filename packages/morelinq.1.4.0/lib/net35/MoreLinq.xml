        <member name="M:MoreLinq.MoreEnumerable.SkipUntil``1(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable{``0},System.Func{``0,System.Boolean})">
            <summary>
            Skips items from the input sequence until the given predicate returns true
            when applied to the current source item; that item will be the last skipped.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            SkipUntil differs from Enumerable.SkipWhile in two respects. Firstly, the sense
            of the predicate is reversed: it is expected that the predicate will return false
            to start with, and then return true - for example, when trying to find a matching
            item in a sequence.
            </para>
            <para>
            Secondly, SkipUntil skips the element which causes the predicate to return true. For
            example, in a sequence <code>{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }</code> and with a predicate of
            <code>x =&gt; x == 3</code>, the result would be <code>{ 4, 5 }</code>.
            </para>
            <para>
            SkipUntil is as lazy as possible: it will not iterate over the source sequence
            until it has to, it won't iterate further than it has to, and it won't evaluate
            the predicate until it has to. (This means that an item may be returned which would
            actually cause the predicate to throw an exception if it were evaluated, so long as
            it comes after the first item causing the predicate to return true.)

        <member name="M:MoreLinq.MoreEnumerable.TakeUntil``1(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable{``0},System.Func{``0,System.Boolean})">
            <summary>
            Returns items from the input sequence until the given predicate returns true
            when applied to the current source item; that item will be the last returned.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            TakeUntil differs from Enumerable.TakeWhile in two respects. Firstly, the sense
            of the predicate is reversed: it is expected that the predicate will return false
            to start with, and then return true - for example, when trying to find a matching
            item in a sequence.
            </para>
            <para>
            Secondly, TakeUntil yields the element which causes the predicate to return true. For
            example, in a sequence <code>{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }</code> and with a predicate of
            <code>x =&gt; x == 3</code>, the result would be <code>{ 1, 2, 3 }</code>.
            </para>
            <para>
            TakeUntil is as lazy as possible: it will not iterate over the source sequence
            until it has to, it won't iterate further than it has to, and it won't evaluate
            the predicate until it has to. (This means that an item may be returned which would
            actually cause the predicate to throw an exception if it were evaluated, so long as
            no more items of data are requested.)
