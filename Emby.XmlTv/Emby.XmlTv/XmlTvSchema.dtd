<!-- DTD for TV listings

This is a DTD to represent a TV listing.  It doesn't explicitly group
programmes by day or by channel, instead broadcast time and channel
are attributes of the 'programme' element.  Optionally, data about the
TV channels used can be stored in 'channel' elements.

Data about a TV programme are stored in the subelements of element
'programme', but metadata such as when it will be broadcast are stored
as attributes.

Many of the details have a 'lang' attribute so that you can
store them in multiple languages or have mixed languages in a single
listing.  This 'lang' should be the two-letter code such as 'en' or
'fr_FR'.  Or you can just leave it out and let your reader take a
guess.

Unless otherwise specified, an element containing CDATA must have some
text if it is written.

An example XML file for this DTD might look like this:

<tv generator-info-name="my listings generator">
  <channel id="3sat.de">
    <display-name lang="de">3SAT</display-name>
  </channel>
  <channel id="das-erste.de">
    <display-name lang="de">ARD</display-name>
    <display-name lang="de">Das Erste</display-name>
  </channel>

  <programme start="200006031633" channel="3sat.de">
    <title lang="de">blah</title>
    <title lang="en">blah</title>
    <desc lang="de">
       Blah Blah Blah.
    </desc>
    <credits>
      <director>blah</director>
      <actor>a</actor>
      <actor>b</actor>
    </credits>
    <date>19901011</date>
    <country>ES</country>
    <episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2 . 9 . 0/1</episode-num>
    <video>
      <aspect>16:9</aspect>
    </video>
    <rating system="MPAA">
      <value>PG</value>
      <icon src="pg_symbol.png" />
    </rating>
    <star-rating>
      <value>3/3</value>
    </star-rating>
  </programme>
  <programme> ... </programme>
  ...
</tv>

This describes two channels and then a programme broadcast on one of
the channels, then some more programmes.  Almost everything in the DTD
is optional, so you can write files which are much simpler than this
example.

All dates and times in this DTD follow the same format, loosely based
on ISO 8601.  They can be 'YYYYMMDDhhmmss' or some initial
substring, for example if you only know the year and month you can
have 'YYYYMM'.  You can also append a timezone to the end; if no
explicit timezone is given, UTC is assumed.  Examples:
'200007281733 BST', '200209', '19880523083000 +0300'.  (BST == +0100.)

Unless specified otherwise, textual element content may not contain
newlines - this is to make it easy to convert into line-oriented
formats, and to avoid the question of what exactly a newline would
mean in the middle of someone's name or whatever.  Leading and
trailing whitespace in element content is not significant.

At present versions of this DTD correspond to releases of the 'xmltv'
package, which is a set of programs to generate and manipulate files
conforming to this DTD.  Written by Ed Avis (ed@membled.com) and
Gottfried Szing, thanks to others for suggestions.

<!-- The root element, tv.

Date should be the date when the listings were originally produced in
whatever format; if you're converting data from another source, then
use the date given by that source.  The date when the conversion
itself was done is not important.

To indicate the source of the listings, there are three attributes you
can define:

'source-info-url' is a URL describing the data source in
some human-readable form.  So if you are getting your listings from
SAT.1, you might set this to the URL of a page explaining how to
subscribe to their feed.  If you are getting them from a website, the
URL might be the index of the site or at least of the TV listings
section.

'source-info-name' is the link text for that URL; it should
generally be the human-readable name of your listings supplier.
Sometimes the link text might be printed without the link itself, in
hardcopy listings for example.

'source-data-url' is where the actual data is grabbed from.  This
should link directly to the machine-readable data files if possible,
but it's not rigorously defined what 'actual data' means.  If you are
parsing the data from human-readable pages, then it's more appropriate
to link to them with the source-info stuff and omit this attribute.

To publicize your wonderful program which generated this file, you can
use 'generator-info-name' (preferably in the form 'progname/version')
and 'generator-info-url' (a link to more info about the program).

<!-- channel - details of a channel

Each 'programme' element (see below) should have an attribute
'channel' giving the channel on which it is broadcast.  If you want to
provide more detail about channels, you can give some 'channel'
elements before listing the programmes.  The 'id' attribute of the
channel should match what is given in the 'channel' attribute of the
programme.

Typically, all the channels used in a particular TV listing will be
included and then the programmes using those channels.  But it's
entirely optional to include channel details - you can just leave out
channel elements or provide only some of them.  It is also okay to
give just channels and no programmes, if you just want to describe
what TV channels are available in a certain area.

Each channel has one id attribute, which must be unique and should
preferably be in the form suggested by RFC2838 (the 'broadcast'
element of the grammar in that RFC, in other words, a DNS-like name
but without any URI scheme).  Then one or more display names which are
shown to the user.  You might want a different display name for
different languages, but also you can have more than one name for the
same language.  Names listed earlier are considered 'more canonical'.

Since the display name is just there as a way for humans to refer to
the channel, it's acceptable to just put the channel number if it's
fairly universal among viewers of the channel.  But remember that this
isn't an official statement of what channel number has been
allocated, and the same number might be used for a different channel
somewhere else.

The ordering of channel elements makes no difference to the meaning of
the file, since they are looked up by id and not by their position.
However it makes things like diffing easier if you write the channel
elements sorted by ASCII order of their ids.
-->
<!ELEMENT channel (display-name+, icon*, url*) >
<!ATTLIST channel id CDATA #REQUIRED >

<!-- A user-friendly name for the channel - maybe even a channel
number.  List the most canonical / common ones first and the most
obscure names last.  The lang attribute follows RFC 1766.
-->
<!ELEMENT display-name (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST display-name lang CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!-- A URL where you can find out more about the element that contains
it (programme or channel).  This might be the official site, or a fan
page, whatever you like really.

If multiple url elements are given, the most authoritative or official
(which might conflict...) sites should be listed first.
-->
<!ELEMENT url (#PCDATA)>

<!-- programme - details of a single programme transmission

A show will be exactly the same whether it is broadcast at 18:00 or
19:00, and on whichever channel.  Technical details like broadcast
time don't affect the content of the programme itself, so they are
included as attributes of this element.  Start time and channel are
the two that you must include.

Sometimes VCR programming systems like PDC or VPS have their own
notion of 'start time' which is different from the actual start time,
so there are attributes for that.  In practice, stop time will usually
be the start time of the next programme, but if you can get it more
accurate, good for you.  Similarly, you can specify a code for
Gemstar's Showview or VideoPlus programming systems.

TV listings sometimes have the problem of listing two or more
programmes in the same timeslot, such as 'News; Weather'.  We call
this a 'clump' of programmes, and the 'clumpidx' attribute
differentiates between two programmes sharing the same timeslot and
channel.  In this case News would have clumpidx="0/2" and Weather
would have clumpidx="1/2".  If you don't have this problem, be
thankful!

It's intended that start time and stop time, when both are present,
make a half-closed interval: a programme is considered to be
broadcasting _at_ its start time but to stop just before its stop
time.  In this way a programme from 11:00 to 12:00 does not overlap
with another programme from 12:00 to 13:00, not even for a moment.
Nor is there any gap between the two.

To do: Some means of indicating breaks between programmes on the same
channel.  The 'channel' attribute references the 'id' of a channel
element, but the DTD doesn't give a way to specify this constraint.
Perhaps there is some better XML syntax we could use for that.

so normally you'd list only the few most important people.

lang attribute should not be given.  For example,

<country lang="en">Italy</country>
<country>GB</country>
-->
<!ELEMENT country (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST country lang CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!-- Episode number

Not the title of the episode, its number or ID.  There are several
ways of numbering episodes, so the 'system' attribute lets you specify
which you mean.

There are two predefined numbering systems, 'xmltv_ns' and
'onscreen'.

xmltv_ns: This is intended to be a general way to number episodes and
parts of multi-part episodes.  It is three numbers separated by dots,
the first is the series or season, the second the episode number
within that series, and the third the part number, if the programme is
part of a two-parter.  All these numbers are indexed from zero, and
they can be given in the form 'X/Y' to show series X out of Y series
made, or episode X out of Y episodes in this series, or part X of a
Y-part episode.  If any of these aren't known they can be omitted.
You can put spaces whereever you like to make things easier to read.

(NB 'part number' is not used when a whole programme is split in two
for purely scheduling reasons; it's intended for cases where there
really is a 'Part One' and 'Part Two'.  The format doesn't currently
have a way to represent a whole programme that happens to be split
across two or more timeslots.)

Some examples will make things clearer.  The first episode of the
second series is '1.0.0/1' .  If it were a two-part episode, then the
first half would be '1.0.0/2' and the second half '1.0.1/2'.  If you
know that an episode is from the first season, but you don't know
which episode it is or whether it is part of a multiparter, you could
give the episode-num as '0..'.  Here the second and third numbers have
been omitted.  If you know that this is the first part of a three-part
episode, which is the last episode of the first series of thirteen,
its number would be '0 . 12/13 . 0/3'.  The series number is just '0'
because you don't know how many series there are in total - perhaps
the show is still being made!

The other predefined system, onscreen, is to simply copy what the
programme makers write in the credits - 'Episode #FFEE' would
translate to '#FFEE'.

You are encouraged to use one of these two if possible; if xmltv_ns is
not general enough for your needs, let me know.  But if you want, you
can use your own system and give the 'system' attribute as a URL
describing the system you use.

Systems proposed in 2013 to refer to common metadatabases in a
common way:
'themoviedb.org' with the content 'movie/1234' to refer to a movie,
'thetvdb.com' with the content 'series/123456' to refer to a series,
'thetvdb.com' with the content 'episode/123456' to refer to one episode
of a series and 'imdb.com' with the content 'title/tt123455' to refer to
a movie, series or episode.

meaningless.

colour: 'yes' for colour, 'no' for black-and-white.

that it happened) then you can omit the 'channel' attribute.
Similarly you can omit the 'start' attribute if you don't know when
the previous transmission was (though you can of course give just the
year, etc.).

The absence of this element does not say for certain that the
programme is brand new and has never been screened anywhere before.

<!-- 'Premiere'.  Different channels have different meanings for this
word - sometimes it means a film has never before been seen on TV in
that country, but other channels use it to mean 'the first showing of
this film on our channel in the current run'.  It might have been
shown before, but now they have paid for another set of showings,
which makes the first in that set count as a premiere!

So this element doesn't have a clear meaning, just use it to represent
where 'premiere' would appear in a printed TV listing.  You can use
the content of the element to explain exactly what is meant, for
example:

<premiere lang="en">
  First showing on national terrestrial TV
</premiere>

<!-- Last-chance.  In a way this is the opposite of premiere.  Some
channels buy the rights to show a movie a certain number of times, and
the first may be flagged 'premiere', the last as 'last showing'.

For symmetry with premiere, you may use the element content to give a
'paragraph' describing exactly what is meant - it's unlikely to be the
last showing ever!  Otherwise, explicitly put empty content:

programme has been shown, subsequent ones are no longer 'new'.

Note that this does not mean 'new season' or 'new episode' of an
existing show.  You can express part of that using the episode-num
stuff.

'unrated').  You should try to map whatever wacky system your listings
source uses to a number of stars: so for example if they have thumbs
up, thumbs sideways and thumbs down, you could map that to two, one or
zero stars out of two.  If a programme is marked as recommended in a
listings guide you could map this to '1 / 1'. Because there could be many 
ways to provide star-ratings or recommendations for a programme, you can 
specify multiple star-ratings. You can specify the star-rating system
